Implementation reasoning:

- The HttpRequestQuery interface sets the only required method that each HTTP request must have - the getRequestQuery().
  That way different types of HTTP requests can exist based on their query string -> GET, PUT, PATCH, etc.
  The fetch method of the NewsFetcher interface can take any HTTP request that implements HttpRequestQuery, so that way
  each NewsFetcher implementation is not directly aware of the underlying type of HTTP request it is sending to the REST API.
  This consideration is made analogically to one of the main REST architecture principles - each resource
  (in this case: newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines) must be reached only from one URI for any type of CRUD operations.

- The whole creation process of any HTTP request can be done in two main ways depending on the developer's choice.
  The first is with the corresponding HTTP request class constructor. Once an object has been created, its state can be changed
  using the given selector and mutator methods.
  The second (and the more generic way) is with a custom builder. In order that pattern to be applied, a HTTP request implementation
  must provide only a builder() method that to return any of the available builders.
  It is preferable each builder to implement the HttpRequestBuilderAPI in order to override the build() method.
  Besides that the whole build process of a HTTP request depends only on the given builder implementation by the developer.
  The separation between a builder and the object being built (the HTTP request) into different class hierarchies is due to
  the Open-Closed principle, which says that any class (HTTP requests hierarchy) must be open for addition (adding new ways
  for building requests), but closed for modification (an already linked HTTP request with a builder - done in the build() method,
  cannot change its way of building).

- The applied Builder design pattern in the construction of a HTTP request sets as required entities of each HTTP request
  the API key and the keywords collection. All of the other HTTP request entities like country, category adn etc. are optional
  as part of the request query.

- The applied implementation decisions are made in order to make any future upgrades of the NewsFetcher API easier and
  also to not violate the Open-Closed SOLID principle.
